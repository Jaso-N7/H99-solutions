My take on the solutions for [H-99](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

The solutions presented are my own, without looking for or at the answers as a way for me to test my 
understanding outside of the self-study materials.

Feel free to make recommendations.

I am currently going through [Real World Haskell](book.realworldhaskell.org) 
and the [Haskell Wiki Book](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell),
to which I also do the exercises.
